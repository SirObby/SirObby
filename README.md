### Hey there :wave:

My name is Samuel, yet another linux enjoyer, I love playing video games and programming.

I fully support FOSS and I'm a proud [arch](https://archlinux.org) user.

#### ðŸ‘· I'm currently working on:
- _add your stuff here lol_
- _more stuff here.. you get the gist_

You've read this far, might as well check me out on other platforms
